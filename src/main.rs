this statement brings the `io` (input/output) library into scope
the `io` library comes from the standard library (which is known as `std`)

By default, Rust brings only a few types into
the scope of every program in the prelude (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html).

If a type you want isn't in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with
a `use` statement.

            read_line puts what the user types into the string we're passing it, but it also returns a
            value â€” in this case, an `io::Result`. Rust has many types named Result in std.
            A generic Result as well as specific versions for submodules, such as io::Result.

            The Result types are enumerations (enums). An enum is a type that can have a fixed set of
            values, and those values are called the enum's variants. Chapter 6 will cover enums in more
            detail.
            For Result, the variants are `Ok` or `Err`. The `Ok` variant indicates the operation was
            successful, and inside `Ok` is the successfully generated value.
            The `Err` invariant means the operation failed, and `Err` contains information
            about how or why the operation failed.

            The purpose of Result is to encode error-handling information. Values of `Result` have
            methods defined on them. An instance of `io::Result` has an `expect` method that you can
            call. If the returned instance of Result is an `Err` value, expect will cause the program to crash
            and display the message you passed as an argument to `expect`.

            If the `read_line` method returns an `Err`, it would likely be the result of an
            error coming from the underlying operating system. If we didn't call expect, the program
            would compile but we'd also get this warning:
            ``warning: unused `std::result::Result` that must be used.

            parse returns a Result type. In case a user does not type a number (and thus parse
